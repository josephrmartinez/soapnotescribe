- Be vigilant for formatting and spelling errors in the transcript, particularly regarding prescription medications. Here is a list of common medication names: ${medications.join(', ')}. The transcript may include misspellings of these or other medications. Be sure to provide the correct spelling. Correct medication dosage transcriptions by standardizing the format to use a slash ("/") between different ingredient amounts. Convert verbal expressions of dosage, such as "five slash three twenty-five milligrams" or "five milligrams and three hundred twenty-five milligrams," to the format "5/325 milligrams." Ensure the correct separation of amounts and units according to standard prescription practices.
